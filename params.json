Most people hate to do it.\r\n\r\nComputers don't mind doing it, but they make mistakes.\r\n\r\nWe want to make it more fun, by letting the computer do the heavy-lifting while you just correct the mistakes.\r\n\r\nThis way you train the computer to recognize words better.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to improve open-source speech recognition. If you use this application you must give every transcription that you make with it back to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Install the requirements:\r\n    * [Ruby 2.0+](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)\r\n    * [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/)\r\n    * [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)\r\n    * [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)\r\n\r\n2. Fetch the git repository\r\n\r\n    \t  git clone git://github.com/skpvox/LiveTranscriber\r\n\r\n3. Install all gems via bundler\r\n\r\n\t      bundle install\r\n\r\n4. Compile `fatpocketsphinx_continuous`.\r\n    * See `INSTALL` file under `speech_recognition/tools/fatpocketsphinx`\r\n\r\n5. Download the language and acoustic model. Thanks to Peter Grasch for providing these:\r\n    * [Language Model Download](http://files.kde.org/accessibility/Simon/lm/)\r\n    * [Acoustic Model Download](http://files.kde.org/accessibility/Simon/am/)\r\n\r\n6. Extract the speech models and save them like this:\r\n\r\n        speech_recognition/models/hmm/voxforge_en_sphinx.cd_cont_5000/\r\n        speech_recognition/models/dict/essential-sane-65k.fullCased\r\n        speech_recognition/models/lm/ensemble_wiki_ng_se_so_subs_enron_congress_65k_pruned_huge_sorted_cased.lm.DMP\r\n\r\n7. Setup the database by running:\r\n\r\n        rake db:migrate\r\n\r\n8. Run Redis\r\n\r\n        redis-server\r\n\r\n9. Run the project\r\n\r\n        rails server\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\n\r\nYou are encouraged to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at our \"Issues\" page on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the GNU Affaro GPL.\r\n\r\nAny transcriptions made with this application must be shared with the community.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
